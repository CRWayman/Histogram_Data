This repository includes an R code which I developed to help me learn some 
fundamentals of R. This code is intended to take a table of data in which values 
have corresponding frequency values. These could be plotted as a bar chart, 
however, I wanted to put them in a format that could allow the use of a histogram. 
This data is discrete, and was therefore plotted using a bar chart, however the 
use of continuous data would simply require the user to change the geometry of 
qplot to "histogram."
